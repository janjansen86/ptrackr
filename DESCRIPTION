Description: ptrackr allows to track the displacement of single particles via currents defined by a Regional Oceanographic Modelling System (ROMS). 
    ptrackr uses the speed and direction of currents to repeatedly update the position of particles individually at specific time-intervalls for a given time-span. 
    The original purpose of this package is tracking particles from the surface to the seafloor, and modelling the resuspension and sedimentation processes on the seafloor.
